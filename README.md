Welcome to the loops stimulation, a program made using C# with a multitide of functions.

For user convenience, there is a menu which opens at the start and at the end of every program. For user convenience, the menu clears after selection and the console clears before being opened.

Functions include reverse counters, sum of prime numbers, creating custom multiplication/exponent tables and even a special PI formula.
